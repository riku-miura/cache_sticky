# Cache Sticky Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST follow consistent style guidelines with automated linting and formatting. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes. Zero tolerance for code smells, unused variables, or dead code. Technical debt MUST be documented and addressed within sprint cycles.

**Rationale**: Consistent code quality reduces maintenance burden, improves readability, and prevents bugs from reaching production.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. Minimum 90% code coverage required. All features require unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. No code ships without passing tests.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code correctness, prevents regressions, and drives better software design through testable interfaces.

### III. User Experience Consistency
UI components MUST follow design system patterns. User interactions MUST be predictable and follow established conventions. Error messages MUST be user-friendly and actionable. Loading states and feedback MUST be provided for all user actions.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user satisfaction, and reduces support burden.

### IV. Performance Standards
Response times MUST be under 200ms for API endpoints. Page load times MUST be under 2 seconds. Memory usage MUST be optimized with proper cleanup of resources. Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed appropriately.

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user experience and system scalability. Poor performance leads to user abandonment and increased infrastructure costs.

### V. Security & Data Protection
All user inputs MUST be validated and sanitized. Authentication and authorization MUST be implemented for all protected resources. Sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit. Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed immediately.

**Rationale**: Security breaches can result in data loss, legal liability, and loss of user trust.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
- All code changes require peer review before merging
- Automated checks (linting, testing, security scanning) must pass
- Review checklist includes constitution compliance verification
- Documentation must be updated with code changes

### Quality Gates
- Unit tests must pass with 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests must validate end-to-end functionality
- Performance benchmarks must meet defined thresholds
- Security scans must show no critical vulnerabilities

## Deployment Standards

### Release Criteria
- All tests passing in staging environment
- Performance metrics validated under load
- Security review completed for new features
- Rollback plan documented and tested

### Monitoring Requirements
- Application performance monitoring (APM) for all services
- Error tracking and alerting for critical issues
- User experience monitoring for key user journeys
- Infrastructure monitoring for system health

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. All team members are responsible for upholding these principles. Amendments require team consensus and documented justification.

**Compliance Review**: All pull requests must verify adherence to constitutional principles before merging. Violations must be addressed before code acceptance.

**Amendment Process**: Changes to this constitution require unanimous team agreement, impact assessment, and migration plan for existing code.

**Enforcement**: Regular audits will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance. Non-compliance issues must be resolved within one sprint cycle.
