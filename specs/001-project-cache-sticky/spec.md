# Feature Specification: Cache Sticky Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-cache-sticky`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A minimal, frontend-only web application to visualize browser Cache API behavior. Users can create sticky notes (\"fusen\") on a whiteboard, and see how they persist or disappear when browser cache is cleared."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  Feature description provided with clear goals
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’  Identified: users, sticky notes, whiteboard, Cache API, persistence behavior
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No ambiguities requiring clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  Clear user flow for note creation and cache observation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’  StickyNote entity with clear attributes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’  No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer or student wants to understand how the browser Cache API works by creating sticky notes on a digital whiteboard. They add multiple notes, refresh the page to see notes persist, then clear the browser cache to observe how all notes disappear, demonstrating cache behavior visually.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty whiteboard, **When** user clicks "New Note" button, **Then** a new yellow sticky note appears with editable text field
2. **Given** user is editing a new note, **When** user types text and saves, **Then** the note becomes non-editable and persists on the whiteboard
3. **Given** existing notes on whiteboard, **When** user refreshes the page, **Then** all previously created notes are restored from cache and displayed
4. **Given** notes are stored in cache, **When** user clears browser cache via dev tools, **Then** all notes disappear on next page reload
5. **Given** user is creating a new note, **When** they attempt to edit existing notes, **Then** existing notes remain non-editable until new note is saved

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user creates hundreds of notes? (Performance observation)
- What happens when note text reaches 200 character limit?
- What happens when browser cache quota is exceeded?
- What happens when Cache API is not supported by browser?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a blank white whiteboard interface on initial load
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a "New Note" button to create sticky notes
- **FR-003**: System MUST create yellow rectangular sticky notes with text input capability
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce a maximum of 200 characters per sticky note
- **FR-005**: System MUST make all existing notes non-editable when a new note is being created
- **FR-006**: System MUST save notes to browser Cache API when user finishes editing
- **FR-007**: System MUST restore all notes from Cache API on page load
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow unlimited number of notes (bounded by browser cache limits)
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent users from deleting notes once created
- **FR-010**: System MUST demonstrate cache persistence behavior when browser cache is cleared
- **FR-011**: System MUST display notes as simple rectangles with readable text styling
- **FR-012**: System MUST operate entirely in the frontend without external backend dependencies

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **StickyNote**: Represents a user-created note with text content (max 200 chars), creation timestamp, unique identifier, and display position on whiteboard
