# Research: Cache Sticky Web Application

## Technology Research Findings

### Build Tool Selection
**Decision**: Vite for TypeScript bundling and development
**Rationale**:
- Fast HMR for development efficiency
- TypeScript support out-of-the-box
- Simple configuration for frontend-only projects
- Modern ES modules support
**Alternatives considered**: Webpack (too complex), Parcel (less TypeScript tooling)

### Cache API Implementation Patterns
**Decision**: Use cache.match() and cache.put() for CRUD operations on note data
**Rationale**:
- Cache API designed for request/response pairs
- Store notes as Response objects with unique URLs
- Enables proper cache clearing behavior demonstration
**Alternatives considered**: localStorage (doesn't demonstrate Cache API), IndexedDB (overkill)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest for unit tests + Playwright for e2e testing
**Rationale**:
- Jest integrates well with TypeScript and Vite
- Playwright provides reliable cross-browser testing
- Can test Cache API behavior in real browser environment
**Alternatives considered**: Cypress (heavier), Vitest (newer, less stable)

### TypeScript Configuration
**Decision**: Strict TypeScript configuration with ES2020 target
**Rationale**:
- Ensures type safety for Cache API usage
- ES2020 provides broad browser compatibility
- Strict mode catches potential runtime errors
**Alternatives considered**: Loose TypeScript (less safe), ES2022 (limited browser support)

### Note Storage Schema
**Decision**: Store notes as JSON in Response bodies with cache keys based on note ID
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with Cache API request/response model
- Enables easy iteration over cached notes
- Supports unique identification and retrieval
**Alternatives considered**: Single cache entry with all notes (harder to manage), File-based storage (not cache-related)

### Browser Compatibility Strategy
**Decision**: Feature detection for Cache API with graceful degradation
**Rationale**:
- Not all browsers support Cache API
- Provides educational value about API availability
- Fallback to memory storage maintains functionality
**Alternatives considered**: Polyfill (defeats educational purpose), Service Worker requirement (too complex)

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Strategy
**Decision**: Virtual DOM library not needed - direct DOM manipulation
**Rationale**:
- Simple application with minimal state changes
- Direct manipulation provides better performance insight
- Reduces bundle size and complexity
**Alternatives considered**: React (overkill), Vue (unnecessary complexity)

### Memory Management
**Decision**: Implement explicit cleanup for note event listeners
**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates good memory management practices
- Prevents memory leaks with unlimited notes
- Educational value for performance monitoring
**Alternatives considered**: Framework-managed lifecycle (not applicable)

## Error Handling Strategy

### Cache API Error Handling
**Decision**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
**Rationale**:
- Cache API can fail due to quota exceeded or security restrictions
- Users should understand why cache behavior changes
- Provides learning opportunity about browser limitations
**Alternatives considered**: Silent failures (poor UX), Technical error messages (not user-friendly)

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Client-side validation with character counting and sanitization
**Rationale**:
- Prevents XSS through HTML entity encoding
- 200 character limit clearly communicated to users
- Real-time feedback improves UX
**Alternatives considered**: No validation (security risk), Server-side validation (no backend)
